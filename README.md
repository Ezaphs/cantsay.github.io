# Battle Spot Singles Damage Calculator
First there was Honko's calculator for PS!, then the Bugget Bridge community modified it for their metagame, then the Smogon Battle Spot community came along and modified it to suit their meta. All credit to the original creators, this calculator merely has a facelift and BSS specific sets.

The calculator supports custom sets.  These can be input within the calculator using the official Pokemon Showdown format.

```

The calculator also adds manual auras and aura breaks, as well as a completely new list of VGC '16 sets.  More detailed information can be found [in the blog post](http://nuggetbridge.com/blogs/entry/1149-vgc-2016-damage-calculator/).

The calculator is accessible online via http://cantsay.github.io
